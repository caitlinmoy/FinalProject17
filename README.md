In "Magnet: The Game," the player must survive a normal Magnet school day and evade tragic ends around every corner. They will select between different choices that dictate the actions of their character. Depending on which option they select, the character will earn/lose self-esteem points and grade points. If the player reaches zero self-esteem/grade points, he or she will lose the game.
